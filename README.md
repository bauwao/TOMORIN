# TOMORIN
 A Redstone Computer.
 TOMORIN stands for "The author recently watched MyGO."  
### How to run this file? 
Throw the entire "TOMORIN/FINAL" folder (i.e., the FINAL directory and the file inside) into the "saves/" folder. (Game version: 1.20.1, I think.)

### How does the computer work?
God will tell youâ€”I used magic to make it run.

### How to use it? 
1.There are two demos inside (when I duplicated the computer, something broke somewhere, so the test might not run correctly). One is "HELLOWORLD", and the other is the Fibonacci sequence.

2.Reset the program counter manually.

3.Click the clock.

4.Watch it run.
